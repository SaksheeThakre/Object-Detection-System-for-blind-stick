# Object-Detection-System-for-blind-stick
# The blind stick is integrated with ultrasonic sensor along with light and water sensing. 
# Our proposed project first uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles ahead using ultrasonic waves.
# On sensing obstacles the sensor passes this data to the microcontroller.
